# 😊 Emotion Detection Website  

This project is a **web-based Emotion Detection application** that uses **Python**, **Jupyter Notebook**, and **Streamlit** to analyze text and detect emotions. The application allows users to input text and provides real-time feedback on the detected emotions, offering insights into the emotional tone of the content.  

---

## 🌟 Features  

- 🎭 **Emotion Detection**: Analyze user input to detect emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, fear, and more.  
- 🛠️ **Machine Learning Model**: Built using Python libraries like **scikit-learn**, **NLTK**, or **transformers** for emotion classification.  
- 📊 **Visualization**: Displays emotion probabilities and trends through interactive charts and graphs.  
- 💻 **Streamlit Integration**: Offers a simple and user-friendly web interface.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack  

- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Frontend Framework**: Streamlit (for building the web interface)  
- **Backend Processing**: Jupyter Notebook (for data preprocessing and model training)  
- **Libraries**:  
  - Natural Language Processing: NLTK, spaCy, or Hugging Face Transformers  
  - Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn  
  - Machine Learning: scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch

## 🚀 Getting Started  

### Prerequisites  

Ensure you have Python 3.7+ installed along with the following libraries:  
- `streamlit`  
- `pandas`  
- `numpy`  
- `matplotlib`  
- `scikit-learn`  
- `nltk` or `transformers`  

Install the dependencies using:  
```bash  
pip install -r requirements.txt  
```  

### Running the Application  

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/emotion-detection.git  
   cd emotion-detection  
   ```  

2. Start the Streamlit app:  
   ```bash  
   streamlit run app.py  
   ```  

3. Open the application in your browser at `http://localhost:8501`.

## 📚 How It Works  

1. Input text into the text field.  
2. The system preprocesses the text using NLP techniques.  
3. A machine learning model analyzes the input and predicts the associated emotion.  
4. Results are displayed, including a visualization of emotion probabilities.

## 📊 Example Use Cases  

- 🔍 Sentiment analysis for customer feedback.  
- 📚 Emotional insights for social media content.  
- 💬 Chatbot integration to understand user emotions.
